* Introduction
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: intro
  :END:

  We previously hypothesized that QTLs could disrupt the mechanisms controlling
  the variance of gene expression, and therefore reveal new insights into the
  genetic regulation of differentiation and disease. To investigate this
  hypothesis, we directly observed gene expression variance across 53
  individuals using scRNA-seq, and sought to identify dispersion QTLs (dQTLs)
  which could alter the variance of gene expression across cells within a
  single individual, independently of altering the mean expression. However, we
  failed to discover such QTLs, and demonstrated that variance QTLs can be
  explained by effects on mean expression
  ([[https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008045][Sarkar et al. 2019]]).

  Before attempting to map dQTLs in a followup study, we need to produce
  evidence that there are such effects to find in human cell types.
  /Essentially no studies demonstrate mechanistic evidence of such effects in
  human tissues./ Many studies measure gene expression variance in human
  tissues without estimating the effect of perturbation
  (e.g. [[https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040309][Raj
  et al. 2006]], [[https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12172][Shalek et al. 2013]];
  [[https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13437][Shalek et
  al. 2014]]). [[https://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6332/1433.long][Martinez-Jimenez
  et al. 2018]] (re-analyzed by
  [[https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712(18)30278-3][Eling et
  al. 2018]]) showed that aging changes variability of mouse CD4+ cell gene
  expression; however, clearly this perturbation is a complex combination of
  environmental factors. The strongest evidence is presented by
  [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2642][Wills et al. 2013]], who demonstrated
  that perturbation of human naive B lymphocytes with a GSK3 inhibitor leads to
  changes in variance of downstream gene expression (as measured by qPCR).

  Here, we develop a method to test for differential variance, and use existing
  scRNA-seq datasets to ask whether there are effects which can alter gene
  expression variance /independent/ of altering mean gene expression.

** Mechanistic basis of effects on variance
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: poisson-beta
   :END:

   A simple model for transcriptional regulation is the /telegraph model/
   ([[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580985710271][Peccoud
   and Ycart 1995]],
   [[https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040309][Raj
   et al. 2006]], [[https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2013-14-1-r7][Kim and Marioni
   2013]], [[https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1216379][Munsky et al. 2013]]).
   The steady state of this model can be characterized as a
   [[file:pois-beta.org][Poisson-Beta distribution]]

   \begin{align*}
     m_i \mid \kr, p_i &\sim \Poi(\kr p_i)\\
     p_i \mid \kon, \koff &\sim \B(\kon, \koff)
   \end{align*}

   where:

   - \(m_i\) is the number of molecules in sample \(i\) (considering one gene)
   - \(\kr\) is the rate of transcription
   - \(\kon\) is the rate of off \(\rightarrow\) on promoter switching
   - \(\koff\) is the rate of on \(\rightarrow\) off promoter switching

   and rates are scaled by the decay rate. Under this model

   \begin{align*}
     E[m_i] &= \kr \frac{\kon}{\kon + \koff}\\
     V[m_i] &= \kr \frac{\kon}{\kon + \koff} + \kr^2 \frac{\kon\koff}{(\kon + \koff)^2 (\kon + \koff + 1)}\\
     \text{Fano factor} &= 1 + \frac{\kr\koff}{(\kon + \koff) (\kon + \koff + 1)}
   \end{align*}

   It follows that an effect which changes variance /while leaving the mean
   unchanged/ must leave \(p_i\) unchanged, i.e. equally scale \(\kon\) and
   \(\koff\). This fact raises several questions:

   - Do we know of such a biological mechanism?
   - Should we expect to find one?
   - Does such an effect require convergence of multiple biological mechanisms?
   - This model assumes /all cells are described by the same kinetic
     parameters./ What if subsets of cells change kinetic parameters in
     different directions?

   The Poisson-Beta model describes the process which generates the molecules
   present in each cell; however, it does not include measurement error. To
   model measurement error, assume there are \(m_{ij}\) molecules from gene
   \(j\) in cell \(i\), with \(m_i^+\) molecules total, but we only observe a
   random sample \(x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{ip}\) of the available molecules, in
   which case

   \[ x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{ip} \mid x_i^+ \sim \operatorname{Multinomial}(x_i^+, \lambda_{i1}, \ldots, \lambda_{ip}) \]

   where \(x_i^+ \triangleq \sum_j x_{ij}\), \(\lambda_{ij} \triangleq
   m_{ij} / m_i^+\), and we have assumed that \(x_i^+ \ll m_i^+\). This can be
   transformed into a Poisson model (Baker 1994)

   \[ x_{ij} \sim \Poi(x_i^+ \lambda_{ij}), \qquad j = 1, \ldots, p \]

   Therefore, observed molecule counts \(x_{ij}\) are generated as Poisson
   sampling on top of a Poisson-Beta generative process. However, focusing on
   gene \(j\)

   \[ x_{ij} \sim \Poi(x_i^+ m_{ij} / m_i^+) \approx \operatorname{Binomial}(m_{ij}, x_i^+ / m_i^+) \]

   and we have \(k_r p_i \propto \lambda_{ij}\), yielding a model (via binomial
   thinning; [[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/758524v1][Gerard 2019]])

   \[ x_{ij} \sim \Poi(x_i^+ \kr p_i) \]

   which was proposed by Kim and Marioni 2013. Now suppose we fit a
   Poisson-Gamma model to the observed data, meaning we assume variation in
   \(\lambda_{ij}\) (which is due to stochastic transcription) follows a Gamma
   distribution

   \begin{align*}
     x_i \mid x_i^+, \lambda_i &\sim \Poi(x_i^+ \lambda_i) \\
     \lambda_i \mid \mu, \phi &\sim \Gam(\phi, \phi / \mu)
   \end{align*}

   where:

   - \(x_i^+\) denotes the total number of molecules sequenced in sample \(i\)
   - \(\mu\) denotes the latent mean gene expression
   - \(\phi\) denotes the overdispersion parameter (relative to Poisson)

   Under the Poisson-Gamma model:

   \begin{align*}
     E[x_i] &= x_i^+ \mu \\
     V[x_i] &= x_i^+ \mu + (x_i^+ \mu)^2 \phi \\
     \text{Fano factor} &= 1 + \phi
   \end{align*}

   Naively, it would seem the mean \(\mu\) and overdispersion \(\phi\) will be
   related to each other, through their dependence on \(\kr, \kon,
   \koff\). This possibility raises several questions:

   - If we do find effects on \(\phi\), should we expect them to be independent
     of effects on \(\mu\)?
   - [[https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1216379][Eling et al. 2018]] claim
     data demonstrate this relationship, and propose to correct the
     relationship between \(\mu\) and \(\phi\). Will this approach estimate
     differences in kinetic parameters? Will a different approach estimate the
     kinetic parameters?

** Differential variance
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: diff-var
   :END:

   We assume the following generative model for the data:

   \begin{align*}
     x_{ij} \mid x_i^+ &\sim \operatorname{Poisson}(x_i^+ \lambda_{ij}) \\
     \lambda_{ij} \mid z_i &\sim g_{z_i}(\cdot)
   \end{align*}

   where:

   - \(x_{ij}\) is the number of molecules in sample \(i\) mapping to gene
     \(j\)
   - \(x_i^+\) is the total number of molecules in sample \(i\)
   - \(z_i\) is an indicator variable denoting which group sample \(i\) belongs
     to

   Under this model, the variance in group \(k\) is
   \(\operatorname{Var}(g_{k})\).

   Although it is possible to estimate likelihood ratios comparing the assumed
   model to the null model:

   \begin{align*}
     x_{ij} \mid x_i^+ &\sim \operatorname{Poisson}(x_i^+ \lambda_{ij}) \\
     \lambda_{ij} &\sim g_0(\cdot)
   \end{align*}

   this model comparison will also be significant for differentially expressed
   genes which do not have significant changes in variance.

   As an alternative, if we assume \(g\) is a mixture of a point mass on zero
   and a Gamma distribution:

   \[ g = \pi \delta_0(\cdot) + (1 - \pi) \operatorname{Gamma}(\frac{1}{\phi},
   \frac{1}{\mu\phi}) \]

   then we can estimate differences in \(\phi\) and bootstrap to get
   \(p\)-values. There are three challenges in this approach:

   1. /Boundary values/. In real data, we should expect \(\pi = 0\) (Negative Binomial
      marginal distribution), and even \(\phi = \infty\) ([Zero-inflated] Poisson
      marginal distribution) for some genes.

   2. /Mean-variance relationship/. Eling et al. 2018 claim there is a
      relationship even between \(\mu\) and \(\phi\) in the deconvolved Gamma
      distributions.

   3. /Computational cost/. The bootstraps are expensive, and it is difficult
      to take a hierarchical approach in this setting due to lack of conjugacy.

   As a second alternative, for each gene \(j\) we can estimate \(g_0\) via
   Empirical Bayes, and then recover the posterior distribution:

   \begin{align*}
     \hat{g} &= \hat\pi \delta_0(\cdot) + (1 - \hat\pi)\operatorname{Gamma}(\frac{1}{\hat\phi}, \frac{1}{\hat\mu \hat\phi})\\
     p(\lambda_i \mid x_1, \ldots, x_n, x_1^+, \ldots, x_n^+, \hat{g}) &= \hat\pi \delta_0(\cdot) + (1 - \hat\pi)\operatorname{Gamma}\left(\cdot; x_i +
      \frac{1}{\hat\phi}, x_i^+ + \frac{1}{\hat\mu \hat\phi}\right)
   \end{align*}

   We can then take sample variances of latent gene expression values
   \(E[\lambda_i \mid \cdot]\) across groups.
